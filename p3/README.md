# Project 2
+ By: Murthy Garimella
+ Production URL: http://e15p2.hesweb.me

## Outside resources
1. All license plate images are generated using the site - https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?
2. stackoverflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41206049/time-calculation-in-laravel-taking-input-from-user
3. Parking image  courtesy - Repat-Armenia 

## Notes for instructor
I have made the following assumptions as a part of this application -
 - User need to select the time using the given time range ( 12:00 AM to 11.59 PM)
 - License Plate image is not included as a part of the 'create page', may be included in the next phase
 - Project2 page could be accessed either from the project-2 home page or using the link - http://e15p2.hesweb.me/parkings/create
 - Default Discount Type is set to 'Visitor', assuming if the owner of the vehicle wont have an Id, will be treated as a visitor!
 - Since the remote development server is somewhere in EMEA, the *date* is 4 hrs ahead of USA Eastern Time!
